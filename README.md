## my-js-stacks

This is a little react app for setting up some javascript project boilerplate. Specifically appropriate package dependency.

### features

- command generation (dev/prod)
- json config file generation
- dependency validation (user level)

### TODO

- it's probably worth it to use redux
- add support for all config file types (including webpack.config)
